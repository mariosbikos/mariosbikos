### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Check out my website](https://mariosbikos.com/)

Greetings! Iâ€™m Marios Bikos, a Senior Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience in immersive technologies (C++ & Unreal Engine). I am passionate about building teams, advancing immersive technology, and creating engaging experiences. Currently, I am seeking opportunities in software engineering management, Unreal engineering, or developer advocacy roles.

My academic journey led me through the halls of University College London, where I earned an MSc with Distinction in Computer Graphics, Vision & Imaging, complemented by a Diploma in Electrical & Computer Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece.

In my most recent role, I served as a Staff Software Engineer at a small startup company called Existent, where my mission revolved around simplifying the creation process for XR applications through the use of an Unreal Engine Plugin. Before embarking on this journey, I contributed my expertise as a Senior Unreal SDK Technical Engineer at Bytedance (PICO XR Team). I played a pivotal part in equipping developers with the tools and knowledge to craft engaging XR games tailored for PICO headsets. This experience not only enhanced my technical expertise but also nurtured my knack for problem-solving, demonstrating flexibility in working with game studios of all sizes and experience levels.

Before my tenure at Bytedance, I ventured into the captivating world of gameplay engineering as an Associate Lead Gameplay Engineer at Sharkmob, a Tencent-owned studio. Here, I immersed myself in the development of Exoborne, a AAA multiplayer open-world extraction shooter fueled by Unreal Engine 5. Through this endeavor, I gleaned invaluable insights into game mechanics and player interaction, honing my skills as a versatile engineer. As a Developer Relation Engineer for HTC Vive, I served as a liaison between the Vive R&D Team and EMEA developers. This role allowed me to champion the VIVE technology stack while fostering collaborations within the developer community and establishing trusted relationships with partners.

Iâ€™ve had the privilege of collaborating with Academy Award-winning creatives at Framestore, where I contributed to the development of Virtual Production tools and interactive XR experiences. From crafting immersive Hyper Reality Test Drives for VW China to bringing the magical world of Fantastic Beasts to life in Warner Brosâ€™ AR Experience, my tenure at Framestore was marked by creativity and innovation. At Electric Square, I served as a Games Programmer for Forza Street, contributing to the development of a globally enjoyed racing game. This experience sharpened my skills in game development and fueled my passion for creating entertainment experiences.

In addition to my professional endeavors, Iâ€™ve garnered recognition for my contributions to the tech community. As an IEEE volunteer, Iâ€™ve organized technical events and received accolades such as the 2013 Richard E.Merwin Student Scholarship and the 2012 Regional Exemplary Student Branch Award. Notably, my leadership in organizing Greeceâ€™s inaugural Games Expo earned the prestigious 2013 Gold Darrel Chong Student Activity Award by IEEE.

Check out some of the exciting projects I had the chance to work on, from pioneering VR simulations to interactive experiences, and letâ€™s connect to dig deeper into the boundless possibilities of technology.
